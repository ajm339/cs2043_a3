[Verse]
When you try your best but you don't succeed
What would I do without your smart mouth
When you get what you want but not what you need
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
You got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Stuck in reverseWhen the tears come streaming down your face
What's going on in that beautiful mind
When you lose something you can't replace
I'm on your magical mystery ride
When you love someone but it goes to waste
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright[Bridge]
Could it be worse?Lights will guide you home
My head's underwater
And ignite your bones
But I'm breathing fine
I will try to fix youHigh up above or down below
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind[Chorus]
When you're too in love to let it go
'Cause all of me
But if you never try you'll never know
Loves all of you
Just what you're worthLights will guide you home
Love your curves and all your edges
And ignite your bones
All your perfect imperfections
And I will try to fix youTears stream down your face
Give your all to me
When you lose something you cannot replace
I'll give my all to you
Tears stream down your face
You're my end and my beginning
And ITears stream down your face
Even when I lose I'm winning
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Cause I give you all of me
Tears stream down your face
And you give me all of you, oh[Verse]
And ILights will guide you home
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you[Bridge]
My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
