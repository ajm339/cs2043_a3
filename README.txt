Most scripts output to problem*scriptname.txt

The project was undertaken with many temporary files being utilized, to test each step of the code.  At the end of the script, the temporary files are cleaned up.  This can be altered to use pipes, but we left it in this format to assist in unit testing each step.

This project was more interesting than the previous couple.
